Stupid name, useful service.

Just a friendly Discord bot that gives students the ability to reserve an RDP connection from a list of possible connections.

Using three commands this bot manages a list of RDP connections, allows students to select which connection they would like to reserve, and allows students to release the connection reservation.

Super basic. This was made as a quick tool to help manage a growing Discord server of cybersecurity students working on their final projects.

Check out AvailibotV2 for a bot that returns the live status of multiple remote workstation RDP ports, bypassing the need for reservations!
